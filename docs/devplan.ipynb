The lights are currently controlled by a node-red flow running on a virtual instance of Ubuntu 20.04 running on a Windows 10 computer. The node-red flow also writes a packet of data to a CSV file every 2 minutes. The \"LightStatus.csv\" file is located in the '~/Public' folder and is accessible from any machine on the local network.\n",
